# State Design Pattern

## What
The State Design Pattern falls under behavioral design patterns. This pattern is used when an object changes its behavior based on its internal state. A common example is a mobile alert system, which can switch between different states like Ring, Vibrate, or Silent.

The pattern involves three key components:

1. **Context**: The interface or implementation that the client interacts with. It holds references to the concrete state objects and manages the current state of the object.
2. **State**: An interface that defines the behavior of the object for each state.
3. **Concrete State**: The concrete implementation of the various states, each providing its own behavior.

## Why
The State Design Pattern helps make code more loosely coupled, reliable, and maintainable while reducing complexity. By separating the behavior into distinct classes for each state, the context object can delegate behavior implementation to the appropriate state, leading to cleaner and more modular code.

## How
For implementation details, please refer to the `state_dp.go` file.
