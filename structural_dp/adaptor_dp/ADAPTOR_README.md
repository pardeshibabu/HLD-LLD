# Adapter Design Pattern

## Overview

The Adapter Design Pattern, also known as the Wrapper Design Pattern, is a structural design pattern that enables two incompatible interfaces to work together by using an adapter. This adapter acts as a bridge to connect unrelated objects, allowing them to collaborate seamlessly.

## Key Components

The Adapter Design Pattern consists of the following four key participants:

- **Target Interface**: The interface that the clients will interact with.
- **Adapter**: A wrapper class that implements the target interface and translates requests from the client to the Adaptee.
- **Adaptee**: An existing object that provides functionality the Adapter reuses and adapts for the new target interface.
- **Client**: The entity that communicates with the Adapter.

## Why Use the Adapter Pattern?

The Adapter pattern is useful when you want to use existing functionality without altering it. Instead of changing the interface or modifying existing behavior, you can introduce new functionality by adding an adapter on top of the existing structure. This approach promotes flexibility and reuse of legacy systems or external libraries while meeting new requirements.

## How to Implement

For implementation details and code examples, please refer to the [`adapter.go`](adapter.go) file.
